# The Fundamentals

>First master the fundamentals. When I was young, I never wanted to leave the court until I got things exactly correct. My dream was to become a pro. I don't know if I practiced more than anybody, but I sure practiced enough. I still wonder if somebody--somewhere--was practicing more than me.

## What this is:

As I'm currently looking for work and all my other repositories are Angular-centric I thought it would be a good idea to create a repository showing off fundamental JavaScript skills.

## Things you'll see here:

* A concise explanation of javascript.
* Responsive design.
* Async loading.
* Testing.
* Regex
